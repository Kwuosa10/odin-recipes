    <p><h1>Description</h1></p>

    <p><strong>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio</strong> is a classic Italian pasta dish that’s simple 
    yet packed with flavor. Originating from Naples, it’s made with just 
    a few basic ingredients: spaghetti, garlic, olive oil, and chili flakes, 
    creating a rich and satisfying meal. The beauty of this dish lies in its 
    simplicity—it’s quick to prepare, with the garlic and olive oil creating 
    a savory, aromatic base that perfectly coats the pasta. It’s a perfect go-to 
    meal when you’re craving something light but delicious.</p>

    <p><h1>Ingredients</h1></p>
        <ul>


            <li>200g spaghetti</li>

            <li>4 cloves garlic (sliced thinly)</li>

            <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>

            <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional for a bit of heat)</li>

            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>

            <li>Fresh parsley (chopped)</li>

            <li>Grated Parmesan (optional)</li>


       </ul>


    <p><h1>Steps</h1></p>
       <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the spaghetti:</strong> Boil salted water in a large pot and cook spaghetti according to the package instructions (usually around 8-10 minutes). Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water and drain the rest.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the garlic oil:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and sauté until golden (2-3 minutes), being careful not to burn it.</li>

            <li><strong>Combine pasta and garlic oil:</strong> Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet with the garlic oil. Toss it around to coat the pasta in the oil. If the pasta looks too dry, add a bit of the reserved pasta water.</li>

            <li><strong>Finish the dish:</strong> Sprinkle in red pepper flakes, salt to taste, and chopped parsley. Toss again. Optionally, top with grated Parmesan.</li>

            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
       </ol>
